		Yes, but this one English professor (who is white) is
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<ol>
			<li>frustrated at his conversion narrative in which God saves him from his evil behavior and believes that this is him not taking responsibility for his actions (even though Newton later worked to pass an act ending the English slave trade)</li>
			<li>believes that this is not enough because he only spoke out loudly against the slave trade after public opinion had shifted (although he’d left the slave trade decades prior to his abolitionist writings, and apologized in his pamphlet on the slave trade for how long it had taken him to speak out, saying it was a deep personal sin on his part).</li>
		</ol>

		I’m no expert on John Newton and can’t speak to his inmost heart or what changes God worked in his life. It’s plausible that he was cynical and irredeemable, but I find it equally plausible that he… did actually experience a change worked in his heart by the Spirit? And even if the former is true, the enduring testimony of “Amazing Grace” is proof that God can speak even through horrifically unworthy vessels.

					<p>in that post, quinn was referring to a couple incidents where members of that tumblr clique referred to me with "they" pronouns despite the fact it is fairly well known that i am uncomfortable with them. i think one of the people involved apologized and corrected themselves and its not something i have any bad blood over. but quinn was talking about me being misgendered, not trans women whos PGP is "they"</p>

				<p>yeah I have no memory of that ever happening and also, jobhaver has aggressively misgendered us several times, used terms for our genitals after asking her not to use them, and co-signed posts explicitly calling me a man. And I’m sorry but everyone who co-signs her doing that shit is ‘jobhaver crew’ and are traitors.</p>
