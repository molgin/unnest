		Yes, but this one English professor (who is white) is
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<ol>
			<li>frustrated at his conversion narrative in which God saves him from his evil behavior and believes that this is him not taking responsibility for his actions (even though Newton later worked to pass an act ending the English slave trade)</li>
			<li>believes that this is not enough because he only spoke out loudly against the slave trade after public opinion had shifted (although he’d left the slave trade decades prior to his abolitionist writings, and apologized in his pamphlet on the slave trade for how long it had taken him to speak out, saying it was a deep personal sin on his part).</li>
		</ol>

		I’m no expert on John Newton and can’t speak to his inmost heart or what changes God worked in his life. It’s plausible that he was cynical and irredeemable, but I find it equally plausible that he… did actually experience a change worked in his heart by the Spirit? And even if the former is true, the enduring testimony of “Amazing Grace” is proof that God can speak even through horrifically unworthy vessels.
